                <li>
                  <strong>Cancellation Requests:</strong> Cancellations must be

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cancellation Fees:</strong> Most bookings require a
                  non-refundable deposit (typically 10â€“50% of the booking cost).
                  Additional cancellation fees may apply, ranging from 25% to
                  100% of the booking cost, depending on the service, provider
                  terms, and timing of cancellation. Exact fees will be
                  communicated at booking.

                <li>
                  <strong>Non-Refundable Bookings:</strong> Promotional fares,
                  special offers, or certain holiday packages are non-refundable
                  and non-modifiable, as indicated during booking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Refunds:</strong> Eligible refunds, if any, will be
                  processed within 30 days, less any non-refundable deposits or
                  fees imposed by Safari Sutra or third-party providers. Refunds
                  are subject to third-party provider policies, which may
                  prohibit refunds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Modifications:</strong> Changes to bookings (e.g.,
                  dates, destinations, traveler names) are subject to
                  availability, third-party conditions, and may incur additional
                  fees or fare differences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>No-Show Policy:</strong> Failure to check in or
                  utilize booked services without prior cancellation results in
                  forfeiture of the full booking amount, with no eligibility for
                  refunds.

                We strongly recommend purchasing travel insurance to cover
                cancellations, modifications, or disruptions beyond our control.
                You acknowledge that third-party provider conditions may impose
                stricter cancellation or modification policies, which take
                precedence over Safari Sutra&#39;s terms where applicable.
